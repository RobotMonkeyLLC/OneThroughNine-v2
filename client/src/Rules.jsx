          The rules are simple. You have to find all the matching pairs of cards.
          Click on a card to flip it over and reveal the hidden symbol. Click on
          another card to try and find its match. If the symbols match, the cards
          will remain facing up. If not, the cards will flip back over. The game
          is over when you have matched all the cards.
